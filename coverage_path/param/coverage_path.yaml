queue_size:     1     # The size of the message queue used for publishing and subscribing to topics.
resolution:     0.0   # The spacing between two adjacent coverage path legs in meter. Set to 0 to compute automatically from camera parameters.
fov:            30    # Field of view of the camera in degrees. Used to compute the spacing of coverage path legs, only if resolution is set to 0.
overlap:        0.3   # Relative overlap between two coverage path legs, range: [0,1). Only used if resolution is set to 0.
altitude:       50    # Altitude over ground level in meter. Used to compute the spacing of coverage path legs, only if resolution is set to 0 and altitude not given by action goal.
visualize:      true  # Whether to publish the coverage path on a topic for visualization.
divide_area:    false # Whether to divide the area among the CPSs in the swarm before generating the path. Joining or leaving swarm members will trigger regeneration of the path.
vertical:       false # Whether the sweeping pattern is vertical or horizontal.
turning_points: true  # Whether there are only waypoints at turning points of the path or also waypoints regularly spaced on straight line segments of the path.
swarm_timeout:  5.0   # The time in seconds after which it is assumed that a swarm member has left the swarm if no messages have been received.
states:               # Only CPSs in these states are considered part of the swarm.
