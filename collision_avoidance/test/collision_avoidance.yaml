dist_attract:    6.0    # Distance between CPSs in meter below which attraction starts to decrease. Must be greater than dist_critical.
dist_repulse:    12.0   # Distance between CPSs in meter below which repulsion starts to increase. Must be greater than dist_critical.
# dist_critical:   8.0    # Distance between CPSs in meter below which the collision avoidance will work maximally.
# dist_avoid:      12.0   # Distance between CPSs in meter below which collision avoidance is active.
visualize:       true   # Whether to visualize the avoidance direction.
# Function shapes can be lin, li2, sin, log, or exp. Default is a constant value.
attraction_shape: lin   # The shape of the attraction function.
repulsion_shape: lin    # The shape of the repulsion function.
excluded:               # No collision avoidance in these states.
