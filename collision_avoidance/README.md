# coverage_path
[![Build Status](http://build.ros.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Ksrc_uX__coverage_path__ubuntu_xenial__source)](http://build.ros.org/job/Ksrc_uX__coverage_path__ubuntu_xenial__source/)

This package generates an optimal path to cover a given area with a cyber physical system (CPS).

## Dependencies
This package depends on the following message definitions:
* [geometry_msgs](https://wiki.ros.org/geometry_msgs)
* [nav_msgs](https://wiki.ros.org/nav_msgs)
* [cpswarm_msgs](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/index-msg.html)

The communication between CPSs is based on the [CPSwarm Communication Library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarmio).

The following packages of the [swarm functions library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarm_functions) are required:
* area_division (only if `divide_area=true`)
* state_exchanger

The following packages of the [sensing and actuation library](https://github.com/cpswarm/sensing_actuation) are required:
* area_provider (only if `divide_area=false`)

Further required packages are:
* [roscpp](https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/)
* [tf2](https://wiki.ros.org/tf2/)

## Execution
Run the launch file
```
roslaunch coverage_path coverage_path.launch
```
to launch the `coverage_path` node.

The launch file can be configured with following parameters:
* `id` (integer, default: `1`)
  The identifier (ID) of the CPS used for name spacing in simulation.
* `output` (string, default: `screen`)
  Whether to show the program output (`screen`) or to write it to a log file (`log`).

In the `param` subdirectory there is the parameter file `coverage_path.yaml` that allows to configure the behavior of the `coverage_path` node.

## Nodes

### coverage_path
The `coverage_path` node generates a path that allows a CPS to cover a given area. It uses the area assigned by the area_division package. The generated coverage path is based on a [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) to optimally sweep the area. The path is regenerated when area to be covered changes. The path can be retrieved either as a whole or waypoint after waypoint. In the latter case, the current waypoint is returned, based on the current position of the CPS.

#### Subscribed Topics
* `area/assigned` ([nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid](https://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/OccupancyGrid.html))
  The area to be covered by this CPS. Only called if `divide_area=true`.
* `area/map` ([nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid](https://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/OccupancyGrid.html))
  The area to be covered. Only called if `divide_area=false`.

#### Published Topics
* `coverage_path/path` ([nav_msgs/Path](http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Path.html))
  The generated path for visualization purposes. Only published if the parameter `visualize` is set to true.
* `coverage_path/waypoint` ([geometry_msgs/PointStamped](http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PointStamped.html))
  The current waypoint of the generated path for visualization purposes. Only published if the parameter `visualize` is set to true.
* `coverage_path/mst` ([geometry_msgs/PoseArray](http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseArray.html))
  The minimum spanning tree of the area for visualization purposes. Only published if the parameter `visualize` is set to true.

#### Services
* `coverage_path/path` ([nav_msgs/GetPlan](http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/srv/GetPlan.html))
  Provides the complete generated path.
* `coverage_path/waypoint` ([cpswarm_msgs/GetWaypoint](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/srv/GetWaypoint.html))
  Provides the current waypoint of the generated path.

#### Services Called
* `area/get_area` ([cpswarm_msgs/GetPoints](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/srv/GetPoints.html))
  Get the points defining the polygon of the area to be covered.

#### Parameters
* `~loop_rate` (real, default: `1.5`)
  The frequency in Hz at which to run the control loops.
* `~queue_size` (integer, default: `1`)
  The size of the message queue used for publishing and subscribing to topics.
* `~resolution` (real, default: `1.0`)
  The grid map underlying the path planning will be downsampled to this resolution in meter / cell.
* `~visualize` (boolean, default: `false`)
  Whether to publish the coverage path on a topic for visualization.
* `~divide_area` (boolean, default: `false`)
  Whether to divide the area among the CPSs before generating the path or to generate the path on the complete map. If `true`, downsampling is not available.
* `~vertical` (boolean, default: `false`)
  Whether the sweeping pattern is vertical or horizontal.
* `~turning_points` (boolean, default: `false`)
  Whether there are only waypoints at turning points of the path or also waypoints regularly spaced on straight line segments of the path.
