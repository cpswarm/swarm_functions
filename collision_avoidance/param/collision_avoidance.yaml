queue_size:      10     # The size of the message queue used for publishing and subscribing to topics.
visualize:       false  # Whether to visualize the avoidance direction by publishing on a ROS topic.
dist_critical:   3.0    # Distance between CPSs in meter below which the collision avoidance will work maximally, i.e., maximum repulsion, no attraction.
dist_attract:    6.0    # Distance between CPSs in meter below which attraction starts to decrease. Must be greater than dist_critical.
dist_repulse:    12.0   # Distance between CPSs in meter below which repulsion starts to increase. Must be greater than dist_critical.

attraction_shape: lin   # The shape of the attraction function.
repulsion_shape: sin    # The shape of the repulsion function.
excluded:               # No collision avoidance in these states.
