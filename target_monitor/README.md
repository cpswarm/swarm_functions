# target_monitor
[![Build Status](http://build.ros.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Ksrc_uX__target_monitor__ubuntu_xenial__source)](http://build.ros.org/job/Ksrc_uX__target_monitor__ubuntu_xenial__source/)

This package manages information about targets in a swarm of cyber physical systems (CPSs).

******TODO***: UPDATE DOCUMENTATION

## Dependencies
This package depends on the following message definitions:
* [geometry_msgs](https://wiki.ros.org/geometry_msgs)
* [cpswarm_msgs](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/index-msg.html)

The communication between CPSs is based on the [CPSwarm Communication Library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarmio).

The following packages of the [swarm functions library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarm_functions) are required:
* task_allocation

The following packages of the [sensing and actuation library](https://github.com/cpswarm/sensing_actuation) are required:
* *_pos_provider

Further required packages are:
* [roscpp](https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/)
* [tf2](https://wiki.ros.org/tf2/)

## Execution
Run the launch file
```
roslaunch target_monitor target_monitor.launch
```
to launch the `target_monitor` node.

The launch file can be configured with following parameters:
* `id` (integer, default: `1`)
  The identifier (ID) of the CPS used for name spacing in simulation.
* `output` (string, default: `screen`)
  Whether to show the program output (`screen`) or to write it to a log file (`log`).

In the `param` subdirectory there are two parameter files `target_monitor.yaml` and `targets.yaml` that allows to configure the behavior of the `target_monitor` node. The `targets.yaml` contains the coordinates of the simulated targets. It is only used when the parameter `simulation` is set to `true`. They are given as two list parameters where the list index is the ID of the target.

## Nodes

### target_monitor
The `target_monitor` node keeps track of targets and their positions that are being detected by CPSs in the swarm. They are typically detected by a camera. Each target has a unique numeric ID assigned to it which should be a positive integer. Targets that are detected locally by this CPS are reported through the `target_tracking` topic. It contains the offset between the current position and the target position in form of a transform. This information can either originate from another node or, if `simulation` is set to `true`, from this node. In the latter case, the target detection is triggered according to the current position of the CPS and the coordinates given in the `targets.yaml` parameter file. Targets that are being managed have a certain state associated to them. This is depicted by the following diagram where the transitions are labled with incoming event / outgoing event:

The state of the target changes depending on local and remote events that are exchanged between CPSs through the [CPSwarm Communication Library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarmio).

#### Subscribed Topics

* `cps_selected` ([cpswarm_msgs/TaskAllocatedEvent](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TaskAllocatedEvent.html))
  The event of a target being assigned by this CPS.
* `target_done` ([cpswarm_msgs/TargetPositionEvent](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TargetPositionEvent.html))

* `bridge/events/cps_selected` ([cpswarm_msgs/TaskAllocatedEvent](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TaskAllocatedEvent.html))
  The event of a target being assigned by another CPS. Messages are exchanged between CPSs using the [CPSwarm Communication Library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarmio).
* `bridge/events/target_lost` ([cpswarm_msgs/TargetPositionEvent](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TargetPositionEvent.html))
  The event of a target being lost by another CPS. Messages are exchanged between CPSs using the [CPSwarm Communication Library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarmio).
* `bridge/events/target_done` ([cpswarm_msgs/TargetPositionEvent](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TargetPositionEvent.html))
  The event of a target being completed by another CPS. Messages are exchanged between CPSs using the [CPSwarm Communication Library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarmio).
* `bridge/uuid` ([cpswarm_msgs/TargetPositionEvent](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TargetPositionEvent.html))

#### Published Topics
* `target_tracking` ([cpswarm_msgs/TargetTracking](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TargetTracking.html))
  The offset of the target that is simulated by this node. Messages are published if `simulation` is set to `true` and the distance between the CPS and a simulated target is less than or equal to `fov`.
* `target_found` ([cpswarm_msgs/TargetPositionEvent](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/msg/TargetPositionEvent.html))
  The event of a target being found by this CPS. The event is forwarded by the [CPSwarm Communication Library](https://github.com/cpswarm/swarmio) to the other swarm members.

#### Action Servers
* `cmd/target_done/goal` ([cpswarm_msgs/TargetGoal](https://cpswarm.github.io/cpswarm_msgs/html/action/Target.html))
  Sets the state of a target to done. This invokes the target_done event to be published.

#### Parameters

  The time in seconds after which a target transitions into the state lost when no target information is received.
* `~target_tolerance` (real, default: `0.1`)
  The path of the smach state machine whose state shall be exchanged.
* `~fov` (real, default: `0.5`)
  Range of the target tracking camera in meter. It is used to simulate target detection. Targets within this distance are detected by the CPS.
